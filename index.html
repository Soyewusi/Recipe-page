    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or non-stick spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong>
            <br> • In a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until well combined.
            <br> • Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, creating an even layer. 
            <br> • Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set it aside to cool while preparing the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Cheesecake Filling:</strong>
            <br> • In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar together using an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy (about 2-3 minutes). <br> • Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, mixing until just combined.
            <br> • Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until each egg is fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cheesecake:</strong>
            <br> • Pour the filling over the prepared crust, spreading it evenly.
            <br>• Wrap the bottom of the springform pan with aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in.
            <br>• Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the pan (water bath method).
            <br>• Bake for 60-70 minutes or until the center is almost set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Chill:</strong>
            <br>• Turn off the oven, crack the door open, and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour. This helps prevent cracking.
            <br>• Remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to fully set.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <br>• Run a knife around the edges of the cheesecake before removing the springform pan.
            <br>• Serve as is or with your favorite toppings like fresh fruit, whipped cream, or fruit compote.</li>

    </ol>
